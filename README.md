# NFL Fantasy Football Draft Predictor & Analytics Tool

Please note, this is a *__simplified__* version. I'm not quite ready to share my private repo just yet... I mean, fantasy is a competition, right?

This project uses real 2022-2024 player statistics to train a linear regression model that predicts fantasy football performance for the upcoming 2025 season. It scrapes data from Pro Football Reference for historical stats, FantasyPros for current projections, and combines everything to generate full-season fantasy point predictions and highlight potential sleepers or overvalued players. This is done through custom web scraping functions and machine learning models that I had fun building and experimenting with.

## Quick Start:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kevinveeder/nfl-fantasy-predictor-pt2.git
cd nfl-fantasy-predictor-pt2

# create virtual environment (strongly recommended!)
python -m venv new_env

# activate new environment
new_env\Scripts\activate

# install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python nfl_fantasy_predictor.py
```

## Dependencies

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning models and metrics
- `requests` - HTTP requests for web scraping
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `lxml` - XML/HTML parser

## Overview

- 2022-2024 Player Data scraped from Pro Football Reference and used to train a fantasy points per game (FPPG) prediction model
- Linear Regression Model trained using features like rushing attempts, pass targets, completions, and receptions
- 2025 Fantasy Projections scraped from FantasyPros for QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs
- Model predictions combined with expert projections to identify value picks and draft targets
- Final Output generates ranked draft recommendations with projected fantasy points and model insights

## Features Used for Modeling:

- **Att** - Rushing attempts per game
- **Tgt** - Pass targets (for receivers and running backs)
- **Rec** - Receptions (catches)
- **Cmp** - Pass completions (for quarterbacks)  
- **Att.1** - Passing attempts (for quarterbacks)

These features were chosen because they represent player usage and opportunity, which typically correlates strongly with fantasy production regardless of efficiency.

Yes... This is a *very simple model,* but it's a cool script though.

## How It Works:

**Step 1: Historical Data Collection**
- Scrapes 2022-2024 NFL player stats from Pro Football Reference
- Cleans and processes the data, calculating FPPG (Fantasy Points Per Game)
- Combines multiple seasons for more robust model training
- Filters out players with minimal games played to improve model accuracy

**Step 2: Model Training**
- Uses scikit-learn's Linear Regression to find relationships between usage stats and fantasy points
- Splits data into training/testing sets to evaluate model performance
- Outputs model metrics like Mean Absolute Error and RÂ² score

**Step 3: Current Projections Scraping**
- Scrapes expert projections from FantasyPros for all skill positions
- Handles complex HTML table structures and cleans player data
- Combines projections from multiple positions into unified dataset

**Step 4: Draft Analysis**
- Generates position-specific rankings based on projected fantasy points
- Creates a draft board showing top players at each position
- Exports results to CSV for easy reference during drafts
