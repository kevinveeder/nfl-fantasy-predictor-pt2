## QB-WR Chemistry Deep Dive

### **How Chemistry Scoring Works**

I developed this system because traditional rankings miss a huge piece of the puzzle - how well QBs and WRs actually work together. Here's my approach:

### **Data Collection**
- Scrape 5 years of QB-WR connection data (2020-2024)
- Match QBs to WRs by team-year (primary starter only)
- Filter out noise (minimum 20 targets for meaningful sample)
- Track multi-year connections for longevity bonuses

### **Chemistry Formula**
```
Base Score = (Catch Rate × 0.4) + (Volume Score × 0.3) + (TD Efficiency × 0.3)

Where:
- Catch Rate = Receptions / Targets (0.0 to 1.0)
- Volume Score = min(Targets_Per_Game / 8.0, 1.0) 
- TD Efficiency = min(TDs_Per_Target / 0.08, 1.0)

Final Chemistry Score = Base Score × (1 + Longevity Bonus)
Longevity Bonus = min(Years_Together × 0.1, 0.3)  [max 30%]

Fantasy Multiplier = 0.8 + (Chemistry Score × 0.25)  [range: 0.8x to 1.3x]
```

### **My 'Why'**
- **Catch Rate (40%)**: Most important - shows they're on the same page
- **Volume (30%)**: High targets = QB trusts this WR
- **TD Efficiency (30%)**: Red zone chemistry matters for fantasy
- **Longevity Bonus**: Multi-year connections get rewarded

### **Real Examples**
- **Aaron Rodgers → Davante Adams**: 1.487 chemistry (1.12x multiplier)
- **Joe Burrow → Ja'Marr Chase**: 1.134 chemistry (1.08x multiplier)  
- **Dak Prescott → CeeDee Lamb**: 0.567 chemistry (0.94x penalty)
